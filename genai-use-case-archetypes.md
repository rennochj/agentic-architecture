## Use Case Selection Framework

When evaluating which archetype applies to a given scenario, consider:

1. **Autonomy Level**: How much human oversight is required? (Assistive → Autonomous)
2. **Output Type**: What is being produced? (Text, Code, Media, Actions, Decisions)
3. **Interaction Pattern**: One-shot, conversational, or continuous operation?
4. **Domain Specificity**: General-purpose or specialized knowledge required?
5. **Integration Depth**: Standalone or connected to external systems/tools?
